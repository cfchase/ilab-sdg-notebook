    \ Process Overview\n\nThe objective of this process is to complete manual matching,\
    \ reconciliation, and/or investigation for entries outstanding in the in-scope\
    \ accounts. Investigation in this context may involve activities such as identifying\
    \ the cause of the outstanding entry and determining the required action to resolve,\
    \ and contacting the impacted department to ensure the resolution is completed.\n\
    \nInvestigation is performed for the Transits that have outstanding balances over\
    \ $50 in the in-scope GLs, for two consecutive days.\n\nOutstanding balances within\
    \ +/-$50 range are written off on the first day without investigation using PeopleSoft\
    \ bulk upload process.\n\nData enrichment, Manual Matching, investigation, and\
    \ aging items review should be done in a timely manner, as per the following documented\
    \ process, failing which there is a significant client impact and fin ancial risk\
    \ to RBC if entries are not managed within the defined process.\n\nFor the Branch\
    \ transactions: Investigation, reconciliation and corrections are performed by\
    \ the Second Day team. However, there are dependencies on Symcor and Branches\
    \ for resolving some of the issues. The Second Day Team communicates with the\
    \ branches and Symcor centers to resolve the issues through email.\n\nFor the\
    \ Service Centers/Special Transits transactions : Investigation and reconciliation\
    \ are performed by the Second Day Team but the corrections are processed by the\
    \ Service Centers or Special Transits respectively.\n\n## DB-SUSP-2ND-DAY-BAL\

      process?
  - answer: Investigations are conducted for transits with outstanding balances over
      $50 in the in-scope GLs for two consecutive days. Balances within +/- $50 are
      written off on the first day without investigation using the PeopleSoft bulk
      upload process. The Second Day team handles data enrichment, manual matching,
      investigation, and aging item reviews promptly to avoid significant client impact
      and financial risk to RBC. Branch transactions are investigated, reconciled,
      and corrected by the Second Day team, with dependencies on Symcor and branches
      for some resolutions. The team communicates with branches and Symcor centers
      via email. For Service Centers/Special Transits transactions, the Second Day
      team performs investigation and reconciliation, while corrections are processed
      by the Service Centers or Special Transits.
    question: What steps are involved in the investigation of outstanding balances
      in the Second Day balancing process?
