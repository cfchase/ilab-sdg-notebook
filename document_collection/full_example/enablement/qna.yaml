        - "How may I help you?"
        - "Tell me about your concern."
    - **Discover**
        - "What error messages are you receiving?"
        - "I see a late fee was charged to the account on June 15. Is this the fee you are referring to?"
    - **Resolve**
        - "What were you purchasing?"

  - question: |
      What could I say instead of "I don't know?"

    Journal prompt: Imagine you are meeting with a customer, and you notice their voice is louder than normal and their expression is angry. What can you do to relate to the customer?

    Possible answer: Use empathetic statements to let the customer know you understand their frustration and let them know you are making it a priority to resolve the issue.

    These are examples of statements that allow us to show empathy across differences when relating to the customer.

    |------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Calm down. You're overthinking it. | From what I hear, you are feeling … Is that right?                                                                   |
    | At least you still have ...        | This is a difficult situation and I think you've shown a lot of  courage and strength in how you're handling things. |
    | Here's what I would do.            | Thank you for trusting me with this. It means a lot to me.                                                           |
