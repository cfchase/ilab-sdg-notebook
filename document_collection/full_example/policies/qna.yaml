- context: |
    When you attempt to schedule a payment, we will inform you of the earliest available delivery date. To assure timely payment, you must schedule payments, and your account must be in good standing and have sufficient available funds in the designated deposit account to cover the payment, at least five (5) bank business days before the payment due date, NOT the date after which late payment fees may be assessed.

    If an account does not have sufficient available funds on the scheduled date, we may elect not to initiate one or more of the transfers. If we do elect to initiate the transfer, which may involve one or more attempts on subsequent business days, it may cause an overdraft in your account in which case you shall be fully responsible for the overdraft and any Overdraft Item Fees, as set forth in your Deposit Agreement, as well as all late fees, interest charges or other action taken by the Payee. If an account has sufficient funds on the scheduled date and we initiate the transfer but the account does not have sufficient funds when the payment posts to your account, we will not charge an insufficient funds fee to your deposit account, but you may incur late fees, interest charges or other action taken by the Payee.

    If we fail to process a payment in accordance with your properly completed instructions, we will reimburse you for any late payment fees. As indicated above, some payments may be made by a personal check. Since we can't predict the exact date that a personal check will be presented to us for payment, please make sure you have sufficient funds in your account beginning a few days before your scheduled delivery date and keep such funds available until the payment is deducted from your account.
